#t start the code just type "!" and press enter and the following will be appeared:
<!DOCTYPE html>

#how to change the icon of the tab that is showing a globe: 
in the head add:
    <link
      rel="icon"
      href="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/50/000000/cloud-arrow-left.png"
    />
    
#h tags and p tags which go into the body:
h1 and h2 and h3 and h4 and h5 and h6. the difference is their importance so , for instance 
you write a title in h1 and sub titles in h2 and ...
p stands for paragaph 

#we can distinguish some part of a text like this: we have i & strong & small and ...
    <p>This is the best sport <i> in the</i> world</p>

#good websites are pixels, and icons8 and iconmonstr

#images from the computer or url, url gives an error at the bottom of the pic though:
<img
      src="Images/31600558&domainId=12.jpg"
      alt="Image was not founds duuuuude!!"
      width="1000"
      height="2000"
    />

#video: as U see U can add the source in 2 places , the second one is to emphasize the video
format:
<video src=""
width=
height=
autoplay
controls
>   source src="" type"vide.mp4"
</video>

#to take the user to another website we use anchor or a :
<a
      href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python"
      >Link to the other side is in this text</a
    >
if U want to open it in another tab U should use target="_blank"
and if U want to add an image instead of the text as a button U should do it like this by 
image tabing in place of the text:
<a
      href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python"
      target="_blank"
      ><img src="/Images/iconmonstr-bus-4.svg"
    /></a>
    
#form defined in the body. inside of it we have input. and label. input has types like (text or email or.
buttons(types like submit). we can use action in form to navigate to other pages as well.
also giving a name to an input is necessary since if we try to use that input again, it's gonna 
be saved in that variable. max and min length for input. autocomplete for input or form itself. 

	<form action="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=How+to+install+Python+Libraries+in+Visual+Studio+Code">
      <label for="username">type ur username please </label>
      <input name="karbar" type="text" id="username" maxlength="5" minlength="2" autocomplete="off"/>
    </form>
    
#form. select ( or dropdown list).
 then we have textarea
#placeholder text in inputs.
<input placeholder="type the password here"/>
#radiobuttons
<form>
	<input type="radio" name products value="1" />
	<input type="radio" name products value="2" />
	<input type="radio" name products value="3" />
	<input type="radio" name products value="4" />
</form>



#buttons are added using 2 methods:

      <input type="submit" value="send"> </input>
      
      <button type="submit">بکوب لایکو</button>




#list (ul and ol) defined in the body. U can also have lists inside of lists.
U can also anchor it to another link



<ul>
      <li>salam</li>
      <li>khodafez</li>
    </ul>

#tables we have tr and th and td in them which represent rows and heads and data:

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>usernames</th>
            <th>passwords</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>sobhan</td>
            <td>jahanmard</t>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
# classes and ids:
whenever we make an object its best to give it a class an id if we wanna specify that later on.
U cant have spaces in classes. but an object can be in two classes like below:
	<table class = "table important" id = "tableuspw">
    </table>
table is of classes table and important ( 2 classes)

#div to rap around objects and make them organize , a container
    <div>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <img src="" alt="">
        <img src="" alt="">
        <img src="" alt="">
    </div>
#others like div, containers, with semantic names:
header
nav
section
footer
figure
main

aside : it's on the side of the page


#figure , when U wanna add an image put it inside a figure and U can give it a caption:
    <figure>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <figcaption>this is a painting by picasso</figcaption>
    </figure>
# U can give min and max width for the classes as well

#htlm entities , corroputed format, alternative letters:
